    <b>Q: Why the name change from "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" in the UK to </br>
    "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States ? </b>
  A:"Sorceror" sounds exciting, and nobody in America knows what a philosopher is. </br>
    the American Hollywood-driven market is producing a generation dependent upon "thrill",</br>
    and a sorcerer is more compatible with that than a philosopher!
