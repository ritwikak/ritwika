    <li><u>FUN FACTS</u></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ian McKellen turned down the role of Dumbledore. Having appeared as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, he said, </br>
        “I had enough trouble living up to one legend. Two would be too much to hope for.” </br>
        He also stated it would have been inappropriate to take Richard Harris’ role, as the late actor had called McKellen a “dreadful” actor.</li>
        <li>Harry Melling had lost so much weight that the role of Dudley Dursley was almost recast. Eventually it was decided that </br>
        Melling would continue to play Dudley and would wear a fat suit to make him look heavier.</li>
        <li>The symbols under Sirius Black’s picture on the Wanted Poster translate as “more or less human.”</li>
        <li>Warner Brothers supplied ushers at cinemas with night vision goggles to prevent illegal recording and pirating of the film.</li>
