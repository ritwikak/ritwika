<h1>READING SKILLS</h1>

(reading comprehension). Reading is a means of language acquisition, communication, and of sharing information and ideas.</p>
<p> Nowa days people are readding lesser and lesser and are getting more into visual stimulation. like, movies, tv shows, 
and other electrnic media. </br>
These days the most common heard by the youg generation whih is heard when asked, </br>
<i>"Why do you not read?"</i> is</br>
<i>"Why should i read when i can watch the movie?"</i> or</br>
<i>"Why waste so much of time on a book when i can see the movie in under 2 hours?!"</i>
</p>
