<h1>READING SKILLS</h1>
<p>Reading is a complex "cognitive process" of decoding symbols in order to construct or derive meaning </br>
(reading comprehension). Reading is a means of language acquisition, communication, and of sharing information and ideas.</p>
<p> Nowa days people are readding lesser and lesser and are getting more into visual stimulation. like, movies, tv shows, 
and other electrnic media. </br>
These days the most common heard by the youg generation whih is heard when asked, </br>
<i>"Why do you not read?"</i> is</br>
<i>"Why should i read when i can watch the movie?"</i> or</br>
<i>"Why waste so much of time on a book when i can see the movie in under 2 hours?!"</i>
</p>
<p> <b>It is appaling.</b></br>
Reading has its own merits which can never be compared to watching a movie. </br>
The experience of reading is different and should not be compared and shoved aside by any person, least of all an impatient teenager.</p>
